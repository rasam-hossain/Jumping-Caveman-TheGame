# Jumping Caveman - The Game

This is slightly bigger game slash research project with several game manipulating features. To remove user interaction, initially, the game could be configured through unity interface only using an input config file to create separate game conditions. For demonstration purpose and game playability, I started to add some of the features in the Game UI and made a separate game version which is linked above.

Sample Abstract to the research: There are quite a few number of standard research methods exist for assessing player experience (pX); however, similar attention has not been paid towards tools for inducing pX. It is sometimes quite hectic for a game researcher to find adequate research tools which can be used to operationalize experimental factors of interest effectively without having proper technical knowledge. An open source custom game has been created that can be easily modified at a much finer time resolution to manipulate pX than has previously been done. Several research questions regarding in-game success or failure can be answered with the help of our tool without the researchers having a deep knowledge about the game mechanisms. Hence, performing controllable experiments would become much easier and less time-consuming in the context of Games User Research.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
1. Download a copy of this project to your local machine. You can download it by zipping or use the standard git methods to download the repository to your local machine.
2. In order to run the game, download a copy of Unity game engine (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). You might want to download the latest version since, I might be updating my game with the lates Unity versions.
3. Install the Unity game engine.  
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running


```
1. Run Unity and select the folder where you have downloaded my game. 
2. You might want to start with the scene called "GameMenu" in order to start from the beginning. 
3. You could also choose "MainScene" to see how the game would look like and what options you can edit from the inspector menu.
4. Hit the play button in Unity.
5. Voila ! You have successfully managed to run my game.
6. If you can't get to the step 5, please check with your Unity versions (see if you have the latest version or not, if it has been installed properly, try creating a short scene and check if that runs or not). If you keep failing, please don't hesitate to contact at rasam.bin.hossain@usask.ca with the errors/warnings you are facing.
