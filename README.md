# Project Title

There are quite a few number of standard research methods exist for assessing player experience (pX); however, similar attention has not been paid towards tools for inducing pX. It is sometimes quite hectic for a game researcher to find adequate research tools which can be used to operationalize experimental factors of interest effectively without having proper technical knowledge. An open source custom game has been created that can be easily modified at a much finer time resolution to manipulate pX than has previously been done. Several research questions regarding in-game success or failure can be answered with the help of our tool without the researchers having a deep knowledge about the game mechanisms. Hence, performing controllable experiments would become much easier and less time-consuming in the context of Games User Research.

This is slightly bigger game slash research project with several game manipulating features. To remove user interaction, initially, the game could be configured through unity interface only using an input config file to create separate game conditions. For demonstration purpose and game playability, I started to add some of the features in the Game UI and made a separate game version which is linked above.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
